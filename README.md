# Rate Limiting: Ensuring Stability and Security

Rate limiting is a crucial practice for managing the flow of traffic in web services, ensuring stability, security, and an equitable experience for all users. This technique is particularly useful in environments where a large number of requests can overwhelm server resources.

### What is **Rate Limiting?**

Rate Limiting refers to the practice of controlling the rate of requests that a client can make to a web service within a specified time period. This is achieved by setting limits on the number of allowed requests within specific intervals, such as per second, minute, or hour. When a client reaches or exceeds this limit, subsequent requests may be rejected, delayed, or handled according to the configured policies.

### Why is it Important?

1. **Abuse Prevention**: Rate Limiting is an effective measure to prevent abuses, such as denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) and excessive data scraping.
2. **Protection Against Exploitation**: Limiting the request rate prevents the excessive exploitation of APIs and services, reducing exposure to vulnerabilities.
3. **Equity in Access**: Ensures a fair distribution of resources, preventing a single client from monopolizing bandwidth or server resources.
4. **Service Stability**: Prevents sudden traffic spikes that could lead to server failures, improving the overall stability of the service.

### Demo

To get started, it's necessary to add the package.

```jsx
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.RateLimiting
```

Then configure your Program.cs.

Then add the dependencies

On the first execution, it will allow.

On the second one, it won't allow because we configured the limit to be 1 request, and it will only permit another one after 10 seconds. This configuration is set per IP and client.
